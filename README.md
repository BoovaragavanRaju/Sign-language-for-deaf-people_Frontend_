Sign Language for Deaf People – Frontend is an interactive web application designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the general public.. It can be extended to support multiple sign languages, such as ASL (American Sign Language) and ISL (Indian Sign Language), with minimal changes.
